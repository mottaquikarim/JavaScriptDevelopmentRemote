# JavaScript Development
üéâüéàüéÇüçæüéäüçªüíÉ


*A hands on and practical introduction
 to programming and javascript development.*
 
 JavaScript (js) is one heck of a language. Initially developed over the course of a weekend, it is now one of the most popular programming languages used all over the world. Initially, JavaScript was developed to run in the web browser. Every single website that has ever existed leveraged js to power all dynamic features (colloquially referred to as the ‚Äúfrontend‚Äù). In the past decade, the language has been ported over to run server-side (or, colloquially speaking, on the ‚Äúbackend‚Äù). This was a turning point for the language since it made js the only language needed to build a fully functional, end to end website. These days, javascript is used to build everything: from website front- and back-ends to desktop apps to even IoT (internet of things) hardware based projects. In this course, we will explore all aspects of this language in our quest to master both programming and in particular, practical web development.

This body of text is a living document. It will be updated with course and lecture content as supplied by General Assembly and any custom course material (developed on an as needed basis by lecturer). It is also intended to be the source of truth for all lectures delivered by the course instructors. Keep this document bookmarked and be sure to visit it often for reference.

## Table of Contents
Here are all the lectures for this course. This section will be updated with notes as we make our way through the curriculum.

### PRIOR ITERATIONS

I have preserved a "snapshot" of prior course iterations as a branch of this repo. This is nice because you can still fork off of this repo, switch to that branch and then do as you please (including cloning it down to your local machine). Please find below the list of snapshots.

[Hello, Wrold!](https://medium.com/@the_taqquikarim/console-log-hello-wrold-3e3abeb44396) I'm Taq, Senior Software Engineer at [Intersection](https://twitter.com/intersection_co). I'm also an Adjunct Professor at King's College, where I teach an intro to web devleopment class. [I've taught Front-end Web Development at GA 14x](https://medium.com/@the_taqquikarim/10-lessons-learned-from-100-weeks-of-teaching-fewd-12c43db14f6b) (so far). Currently, I'm teaching a remote Javascript Development class (also at GA) - my second foray into the world of remote instruction. In the past, I've taught some form of coding at institutions such as [C4Q](https://www.c4q.nyc/), [The Startup Institute](https://www.startupinstitute.com/), [NYCDA](https://nycda.com/), [One Month](https://onemonth.com/) and [Columbia Splash](https://columbia.learningu.org/). When I'm not working I am usually [thinking about math](https://medium.com/math-musings/why-does-25-25-2-2-1-100-25-an-explanation-6c7e7b283d41), [building](https://medium.com/@the_taqquikarim/a-technique-for-saving-content-from-a-data-text-html-uri-10f045a8876d) [software](https://medium.com/@the_taqquikarim/introducing-bonfire-2c0e437895e2), or [working](https://photos.app.goo.gl/w1crzgI7DqCgGR373) [on](https://photos.app.goo.gl/EaFkp5SmyO0opkg32) [hardware](https://photos.app.goo.gl/tvxPl2zbIMl7FEnK2) [hacks](https://www.instagram.com/p/8rARZNND_t/?taken-by=taqqui.karim).

Wesley is a JavaScript engineer who makes sure the site works beautifully. Prior to working at Honey, Wesley was an implementation engineer at Sailthru, a content personalization and marketing platform. As a graduate of one of General Assembly's early coding bootcamps himself, Wesley also had a brief stint as a TA for their front-end web development course.

## Useful Op Cmds

Some useful one liners for cleaning up content between iterations

### Removing old class notes content but preserving the folder itself and README
```
find . -name "*" ! -name "*.md" ! -path '*/class_notes/*.md' ! -path "*.git*" ! -path "*stage*" ! -path "./index.html" ! -path "*assets*" -type f -delete
```
