# Homework 2
**DUE** Mon Apr 23rd, Midnight

## Factory Function
Implement the **[JSR ShoppingList Functions](https://github.com/FEWDMaterials/JSR_Shopping_List_Functions/tree/solutions/JSR0312)** as a factory function. 

(Note that I am pointing to my solutions, feel free to use yours instead). Make sure to gut the tests as we don't need those anymore. Or, keep them but move them off of the index.html page (this is optional).

## UI
Using the factory function definition from above, build a UI for our functionality.
**[Details Here](https://github.com/FEWDMaterials/ShoppingListUI)**

**NOTE**: Expectation is to complete the first two "pass" requirements. Everything else is encouraged but optional.
